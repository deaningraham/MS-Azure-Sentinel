# Microsoft Azure Sentinel Lab

## Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

The Purpose of the ***"Microsoft Sentinel Training Lab Solution"*** and by extension this particular lab is to provide hands-on practical experience with the Sentinel product features, capabilities, and scenarios. Sentinel is both a SIEM (Security Information Event Management) and SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) all in one solution, providing both a way to aggregate and ingest logs from various sources and a way to automate and respond to threats and incidents. 

From the [overview page](https://portal.azure.com/#create/azuresentinel.azure-sentinel-solution-azuretraininglab) it says "This solution ingests pre-recorded data into your Microsoft Sentinel workspace and enables several artifacts to simulate scenarios that showcase various Microsoft Sentinel features." In short, this lab will provide cybersecurity analysts with hands on experience with both Sentinel and certian aspects of Azure.

Although this Lab closely follows Microsoft's Training Guide, it is entirely my own work and I have peformed every step. I have also added and expanded certain sections to enhance my personal training and hands-on experience. Additionally, I have updated areas that have changed since the original lab modules were created, and I've included supplementary information for educational purposes. Lastly, some sections, like the labs, were transferred from the original modules, but the work peformed is my own, supported by the screenshots provided.

The main objective was to ingest and analyze logs using a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, creating test telemetry to simulate real-world attack scenarios. This practical exercise aimed to enhance comprehension of network security, attack methodologies, and defensive tactics.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM and SOAR concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Microsoft Azure for the purpose of deploying a virual environment for our lab.
- Utilizing Microsoft Sentinel SIEM and SOAR for log ingestion, analysis, and hands-on experience with automation and response.
- Employing network analysis tools, such as Wireshark, for capturing and examining network traffic.
