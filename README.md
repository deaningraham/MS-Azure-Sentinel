# Microsoft Azure Sentinel Lab

## Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

The Purpose of the ***"Microsoft Sentinel Training Lab Solution"*** and by extension this particular lab is to provide hands-on practical experience with the Sentinel product features, capabilities, and scenarios. Sentinel is both a SIEM (Security Information Event Management) and SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) all in one solution, providing both a way to aggregate and ingest logs from various sources and a way to automate and respond to threats and incidents. 

From the [overview page](https://portal.azure.com/#create/azuresentinel.azure-sentinel-solution-azuretraininglab) it says "This solution ingests pre-recorded data into your Microsoft Sentinel workspace and enables several artifacts to simulate scenarios that showcase various Microsoft Sentinel features." In short, this lab will provide cybersecurity analysts with hands on experience with both Sentinel and certian aspects of Azure.

The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM and SOAR concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Microsoft Azure for the purpose of deploying a virual environment for our lab.
- Utilizing Microsoft Sentinel SIEM and SOAR for log ingestion, analysis, and hands-on experience with automation and response.
- Employing network analysis tools, such as Wireshark, for capturing and examining network traffic.
